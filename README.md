# QPET-Artifact

This is the Artifact repository of VLDB '25 paper submission: **QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression**.

This **main** branch includes the overall readme and the evaluation results. Codes and evaluation instructions are in **other branches**.


## QPET-integrated Compression Codes and Evaluation
**Important:** Please check the other branches for artifact codes and evaluation instructions (the codes are frozen before the submission and revision deadline).

There are two sets of branches. Branch names without **revision** are codes for the initial submission, and Branch names ending with **revision** are codes for the revision submission.

## Supplementary Evaluation Results

The **QPET_Appendix.pdf** contains a complete appendix of QPET experimental results.
