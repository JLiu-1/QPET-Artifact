The following images:
        lenna.pgm
        barbara.pgm
        goldhill.pgm
were retrieved from the Web site of the Image Communications Lab of UCLA
(http://www.icsl.ucla.edu/~ipl).
These images have been used extensively as "standard" images for testing
wavelet coders.  They are all grayscale with a resolution of 512x512.  These
images were originally in a raw binary format, but have been converted to
pgm format here (involves only the addition of a header).

The notes on the origin of the images (as noted at the UCLA site) are as 
follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lena image above is the one from the RPI site; the Barbara image from is 
the lab of Prof. Gersho at UC Santa Barbara. The Goldhill image is from 
R. Joshi of Washington.

A word of caution: Unfortunately, the "standard" images aren't standard, 
and there are several versions of all of the above images that have been 
used to report coding results.

Additionally, we include the file lenna.mask.pgm, a transparency mask for
use with shape-adaptive coding. This mask, for the lenna.pgm image, segments
Lenna from the background.
