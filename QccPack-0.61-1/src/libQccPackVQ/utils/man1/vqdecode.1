.TH VQDECODE 1 "QCCPACK" ""
.SH NAME
vqdecode \- vector-quantization decoding
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vqdecode
.I channelfile
.I codebookfile
.I datfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B vqdecode
decodes the input channel,
.IR channelfile ,
(CHN format) by looking up each channel index
in the input codebook,
.IR codebookfile,
(CBK format) and outputting the corresponding
codeword to the output
.I datfile 
(DAT format).
The channel is produced with
.BR vqencode (1),
and the channel symbols are assumed to range from 0 to N-1, where N is the
number of codewords in 
.IR codebookfile .
The VQ codebook,
.IR codebookfile ,
can be trained using
.BR gla (1).
