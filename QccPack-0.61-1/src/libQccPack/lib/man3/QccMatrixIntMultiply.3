.TH QCCMATRIXINTMULTIPLY 3 "QCCPACK" ""
.SH NAME
QccMatrixIntMultiply
\- multiply two integer matrices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "libQccPack.h"
.sp
.BI "int QccMatrixIntMultiply(const QccMatrixInt " matrix1 ", int " num_rows1 ", int " num_cols1 ", const QccMatrixInt " matrix2 ", int " num_rows2 ", int " num_cols2 ", QccMatrixInt " matrix3 );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B QccMatrixIntMultiply()
multiplies
.IR matrix1 ,
a matrix of dimension
.I num_rows1
x
.I num_cols1
by another matrix,
.IR matrix2 ,
of dimension
.I num_rows2
x
.IR num_cols2 .
The result of the multiplication, a matrix of dimension
.IR num_rows1
x
.IR num_cols2
is returned as
.IR matrix3
which must be allocated to this size before calling
.BR QccMatrixIntMultiply() .
.LP
The inner matrix dimensions must agree for matrix multiplication. That is,
.IR num_cols1
and
.IR num_rows2
must be the same; if not,
.BR QccMatrixIntMultiply()
returns in error.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B QccMatrixIntMultiply()
returns 0 on success, 1 on error.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR QccMatrix (3),
.BR QccPack (3)
