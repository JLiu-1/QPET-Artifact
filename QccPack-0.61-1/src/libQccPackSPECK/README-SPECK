OVERVIEW:

  The QccPackSPECK module is a optional addon to the QccPack library for
  the quantization, compression and coding of data.  The QccPackSPECK module
  provides an implementation of the Set-Partitioning Embedded Block (SPECK)
  algorithm for image compression.  Since the SPECK algorithm is patented,
  it is made available here under special license terms (see below and the
  file LICENSE-SPECK), whereas the QccPack library is licensed under the GNU
  General Public License and the GNU Library General Public License. See the
  file CHANGELOG-SPECK for details of recent changes to the QccPackSPECK code.

  The QccPackSPECK module also provides the 3D-SPECK algorithm for image-cube
  coding. See the file LICENSE-3D-SPECK for licensing information for
  3D-SPECK.

WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION:

  - QccPack Users' Mailing List:
      If you have a general question about QccPack or how to install or use
      QccPack, please consult the QccPack Users' mailing list:
        http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/qccpack-users
      You can browse the list archives, and if no answer to your query is
      there, you can post a message to the list.

  - QccPack Developers' Mailing List:
      If you have a technical question concerning the implementation of
      current or future library routines and utility programs, or if you
      think you have found a bug in some QccPack code, please consult the
      QccPack Developers' mailing list:
        http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/qccpack-devel
      You can browse the list archives, and if no answer to your query is
      there, you can post a message to the list. In particular, before
      submitting a bug report, please verify that your bug is not a known
      problem by scanning the list archives.

  Please use the above mailing lists rather than contacting the QccPack
  developers directly; the lists are monitor by the developers (and many
  others), so your post will be responded to in a timely fashion.

INSTALLATION:

Installation Note:

  To compile the QccPackSPECK module, you must have already obtained
  the main QccPack source-code distribution, untarred it to a directory,
  and configured the QccPack.config properly to build QccPack. Refer to
  the installation instructions for QccPack for details on how to 
  accomplish these tasks before proceeding with the instructions below.

Installation Steps:
        
    - Untar the QccPackSPECK module distribution into the directory
      in which you have previously untarred the QccPack source-code
      distribution.  Specifically, if you have placed the QccPack
      source code into the directory /usr/local/QccPack, and the
      QccPackSPECK module tar file is /usr/local/QccPackSPECK.tar,
      do the following:
        - Type "cd /usr/local/QccPack"
        - Type "tar xvf /usr/local/QccPackSPECK.tar"
    - Edit the file QccPack.config :
        - Uncomment the line that reads #define QCCPACK_SPECK to enable
            the optional QccPackSPECK module
    - Now (re)build the Makefiles and (re)compile the QccPack source:
        - Type "imake".
        - Type "make Makefiles".
        - Type "make".
        - When you're happy that things compiled OK, type "make install" to
            put the libraries, header files, binaries, and man pages into
            their final installation locations.
    - Type "man QccPackSPECK" or point your browser to
        file:$(QCCPACK_INSTALL)/doc/QccPackSPECK.3.html to view the available
        documentation for the QccPackSPECK module.
