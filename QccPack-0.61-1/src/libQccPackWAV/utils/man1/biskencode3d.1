.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B biskencode3d
codes an image cube,
.IR icbfile ,
using the 3D-BISK algorithm by Rucker and Fowler.
The 3D-BISK algorithm involves a 3D DWT followed by 
a progressive "bitplane" coding of the wavelet coefficients using a
cube-splitting quantization structure based on
.IR k -d
trees.
.LP
The transform is either the usual discrete
wavelet transform (DWT) or a shape-adaptive
DWT (SA-DWT) and can be either a dyadic or wavelet-packet
decomposition; see
.BR QccWAVbisk3DEncode (3)
for complete details.
Option
.B \-w
specifies the wavelet, 
option
.B \-b
specifies the boundary extension.
The
.B \-m
option gives the image-cube file to be used as a transparency mask
for the SA-DWT.
.I mask
must be a grayscale image cube
in which black in this image cube indicates transparency, white
indicates full opacity, and gray tones are degrees of translucence
(see
.BR QccAlpha (3)).
If the
.B \-m
option is not given, the usual, full-volume DWT is used.
.LP
The
.BR \-nl ,
.BR \-sl ,
and
.BR \-tl
options determine whether a dyadic or wavelet-packet transform is used.
If
.B \-nl
is specified, a dyadic transform is used. In this case,
.IR num_levels
is the number of decompositions in all three directions.
If either
.B \-sl
or
.BR \-tl ,
or
both, is specified, a wavelet-packet transform is used.
In this case,
.I spatial_num_levels
and
.I temporal_num_levels
give the number of decompositions spatially and temporally, respectively,
of the packet transform. If only one of
.B \-sl
and
.B \-tl
is given, then the same number of decompositions
is used spatially and temporally.
In the case that none of
.BR \-nl ,
.BR \-sl ,
and
.BR \-tl 
is specified, then a dyadic decomposition with the default value of
.I num_levels
is used.
.LP
The desired bitrate of the output
.I bitstream
is specified by
.IR rate ,
which is expressed in bits per voxel of the original image.
.B biskencode3d
normally prints to stdout a small amount of information
concerning this target bitrate and the actual bitrate achieved.
Usually these rates are identical, but may differ slightly.
If the 
.B \-vo
(value-only) option is given, all printed output is suppressed except for
the actual bitrate.
.LP
.B biskdecode3d
performs the corresponding decoding using the 3D-BISK algorithm, decoding
the
.I bitstream
made by
.B biskencode3d
and producing
a reconstructed image cube,
.IR icbfile .
For sane results, 
.IR wavelet 
and
.IR boundary 
should be the same as they were for
.BR biskencode3d ,
and
.I mask
should be the same if an SA-DWT was used as the transform.
If a decoding rate is specified with the
.B \-r
option, then
.B biskdecode3d
stops decoding when
.I rate
bits per voxel from the input bitstream
have been decoded. Otherwise, decoding stops when the
end of the input bitstream is reached.
.LP
.BR biskencode3d
and
.BR biskdecode3d
call
.BR QccWAVbisk3DEncode (3)
and
.BR QccWAVbisk3DDecode (3),
respectively, to perform 3D-BISK encoding and decoding.
Refer to the man pages for these functions for more information
on the details of the QccPack implementation of the 3D-BISK algorithm.
