.SH OPTIONS
.TP

String. 
Name of the wavelet file

format); default = "CohenDaubechiesFeauveau.5-3.int.lft"
.TP
.BI \-b " boundary"
String. Type of boundary extension; default = "symmetric".
.TP 
.BI \-nl " num_levels"

default is verbose output.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B klttceencode3d_lossless
codes an image cube,
.IR icbfile ,
using the lossless, or reversible, KLT+3D-TCE algorithm;
see
.BR QccWAVklttce3DLosslessEncode (3)
for more detail.
.LP
The transform is a hybrid combination of a reversible spectral KLT
plus a reversible dyadic DWT applied spatially.
The
.B \-w
option specifies the wavelet, the
.B \-b
option specifies the boundary extension, and
the
.BR \-nl ,
option specifies the number of decomposition levels for the
spatial DWT.
.LP
The KLT+3D-TCE algorithm performance is determined in part through
the parameter
.IR alpha ,
a value that gives the learning rate of the density-estimation
process implemented by the tarp filter used in one of
the coding passes of the TCE algorithm.
.LP
.B klttceencode3d_lossless
normally prints to stdout a small amount of information
concerning the actual bitrate achieved.
If the 
.B \-vo
(value-only) option is given, all printed output is suppressed except for
the actual bitrate.
.LP
.B klttcedecode3d_lossless
performs the corresponding decoding using the lossless KLT+3D-TCE algorithm,
decoding the
.I bitstream
made by
.B klttceencode3d_lossless
and producing
a reconstructed image cube,
.IR icbfile .
For sane results, 
.IR wavelet 
and
.IR boundary 
should be the same as they were for
.BR klttceencode3d_lossless .
If a decoding rate is specified with the
.B \-r
option, then
.B klttcedecode3d_lossless
stops decoding when
.I rate
bits per voxel from the input bitstream
have been decoded. Otherwise, decoding stops when the
end of the input bitstream is reached.
In this latter case, a lossless reconstruction of the original encoded
image will be produced. Otherwise, a lossy representation that differs
from the original image will result.
.LP
.BR klttceencode3d_lossless
and
.BR klttcedecode3d_lossless
call
.BR QccWAVklttce3DLosslessEncode (3)
and
.BR QccWAVklttce3DLosslessDecode (3),
respectively, to perform lossless KLT+3D-TCE encoding and decoding.
Refer to the man pages for these functions for more information
on the details of the QccPack implementation of the lossless
KLT+3D-TCE algorithm.
