<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">DESCRIPTION </A></H2>
<B>QccWAVLiftingAnalysis()</B> essentially performs one level of 
a wavelet decomposition. Specifically, lifting analysis is employed to 
produce a lowpass subband and a highpass subband of <I>signal</I>. The lowpass 
subband is returned as the first half of <I>signal</I>; the highpass subband 
is returned as the last half of <I>signal</I>. <I>signal_length</I> gives the length 
of <I>signal</I> and may be even or odd. <P>
If <I>phase</I> is <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_PHASE_EVEN</B>, 
then <I>signal</I> is assumed to start with a even-indexed sample. Otherwise, if 
<I>phase</I> is <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_PHASE_ODD</B>, it indicates that <I>signal</I> starts with 
an odd-indexed sample. <I>phase</I> is passed to <B><A HREF="QccWAVWaveletLWT.3.html">QccWAVWaveletLWT</B>(3)</A>
, the lazy 
wavelet transform, the first step of lifting analysis, to indicate the 
signal origin. <P>
In the case that <I>signal_length</I> is even, both the odd and 
even subbands of produced by lifting analysis are the same length.  On 
the other hand, if <I>signal_length</I> is odd, one of the two subbands will 
be one sample longer than the other. Which subband will be longer will 
depend on the value of <I>phase</I>. Specifically, if <I>phase</I> is <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_PHASE_EVEN</B>, 
then the lowpass subband is one sample longer than the highpass subband. 
If <I>phase</I> is <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_PHASE_ODD</B>, the the highpass subband is one sample 
longer than the lowpass subband. <P>
<I>lifting_scheme</I> gives the particular lifting 
scheme to employ. Lifting implementations of wavelet analysis and synthesis 
are "hard-coded" into the QccPack library for purposes of execution speed 
and ease of implementation (this is opposed to the situation for filter-based 
analysis and synthesis which employ generic filter routines and read coefficients 
from files). As a consequence, only a limited number of wavelets are current 
supported, and this list cannot be extended by the user (without modifying 
the QccPack source code, or course). The currently supported lifting schemes 
and their corresponding <B>LFT</B> files (see <B><A HREF="QccWAVLiftingScheme.3.html">QccWAVLiftingScheme</B>(3)</A>
) are  <blockquote><P>

 <BR>
Daubechies.4.lft - length 4 orthogonal wavelet  </blockquote>
<P>
<B>QccWAVLiftingSynthesis()</B> 
performs one level of wavelet synthesis.  The first half of <I>signal</I> is assumed 
to contain the lowpass subband while the second half contains the highpass 
subband. Lifting synthesis is performed to produce the output signal which 
is returned in <I>signal</I>, including a call to <B><A HREF="QccWAVWaveletInverseLWT.3.html">QccWAVWaveletInverseLWT</B>(3)</A>
 
to perform an inverse lazy wavelet transform. As with <B>QccWAVLiftingAnalysis()</B>, 
<I>signal_length</I> may be even or odd. <I>phase</I> indicates whether the output <I>signal</I> 
is to start with an even- or odd-indexed sample. <P>
<I>boundary</I> indicates how lifting 
should be handled at the ends of the signal and can be one of the following: 
<B>QCCWAVWAVELET_BOUNDARY_SYMMETRIC_EXTENSION</B> (symmetric extension, valid 
only for biorthogonal wavelets), <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_BOUNDARY_PERIODIC_EXTENSION</B> 
(periodic extension, valid for orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets), 
or <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_BOUNDARY_BOUNDARY_WAVELET</B> (boundary wavelet, valid for 
orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets). Check the comments at the start 
of each <B>LFT</B> file for permitted values for <I>boundary</I> for particular lifting 
schemes. Note that, if periodic extension is used, <I>signal_length</I> must be 
even (this is due to mathematical constraints). <P>
The case in which <I>signal_length</I> 
is equal to 1 is degenerate. A wavelet transform is technically not well 
defined for this situation because it is not clear how to subsample the 
signal. However, in practice, this degenerate case can be handled in several 
ways with no problems. In QccPack, the length-one signal is merely multiplied 
by <A HREF="sqrt.2.html">sqrt(2)</A>
 and placed in the lowpass subband (in which case the highpass 
subband has zero length) for  <I>phase</I> equal to <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_PHASE_EVEN</B>, 
or divided by <A HREF="sqrt.2.html">sqrt(2)</A>
 and placed in the highpass subband (in which case 
the lowpass subband has zero length) for <I>phase</I> equal to <B>QCCWAVWAVELET_PHASE_ODD</B>. 
<P>
Note: In general, you will probably want to use <B><A HREF="QccWAVWaveletDWT1D.3.html">QccWAVWaveletDWT1D</B>(3)</A>
 
and <B><A HREF="QccWAVWaveletInverseDWT1D.3.html">QccWAVWaveletInverseDWT1D</B>(3)</A>
 instead of these routines for implementing 
a discrete wavelet transform and its inverse since <B><A HREF="QccWAVWaveletDWT1D.3.html">QccWAVWaveletDWT1D</B>(3)</A>
 
and <B><A HREF="QccWAVWaveletInverseDWT1D.3.html">QccWAVWaveletInverseDWT1D</B>(3)</A>
 allow any number of scales, or levels, 
of decomposition to be performed, and can be used with either filter-bank 
or lifting implementations of wavelets.  
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">RETURN VALUES </A></H2>
These routines return 
0 on success and 1 on error.
