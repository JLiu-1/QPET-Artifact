<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">DESCRIPTION </A></H2>
<B>QccWAVWaveletShapeAdaptiveDWT1D()</B> performs a shape-adaptive 
discrete wavelet transform (SA-DWT) of a one-dimensional signal. <I>num_scales</I> 
gives the number of scales, or levels, of the decomposition. <B>QccWAVWaveletShapeAdaptiveDWT1D()</B> 
implements a dyadic decomposition of <I>signal</I>; that is, the lowpass subband 
is recursively decomposed into lowpass and highpass bands for each level 
of decomposition. The output of the SA-DWT is returned in <I>signal</I>, overwriting 
the original input signal. The output subbands reside in  <I>signal</I> starting 
with the lowpass subband of the lowest (coarsest) level of decomposition 
(i.e., the baseband) with subsequent highpass subbands of increasing resolution 
following. <P>
<I>mask</I> indicates where the original input <I>signal</I> exists. That is, 
 <I>mask</I> indicates the intervals of support in the original input <I>signal</I>. 
Where <I>mask</I> is less than or equal to <B>QCCALPHA_TRANSPARENT</B>, there is no 
signal, and where <I>mask</I> is greater than <B>QCCALPHA_TRANSPARENT</B>, the signal 
exists and is transformed (see <B><A HREF="QccAlpha.3.html">QccAlpha</B>(3)</A>
). Essentially this shape-adaptive 
transform is performed by identifying contiguous non-transparent segments 
of the input signal, and transforming these segments individually with 
a usual 1D DWT  (via a call to <B><A HREF="QccWAVWaveletDWT1D.3.html">QccWAVWaveletDWT1D</B>(3)</A>
) with appropriate 
extension at the ends of each segment. Each segment is transformed so that 
the global subsampling scheme for the signal is respected; that is, the 
starting index for each segment is determined to be either odd or even 
based upon its location relative to the start of <I>signal</I>, and this determines 
whether odd or even subsampling is used in the DWT of the segment. <P>
The 
transparency mask is transformed (with a Lazy wavelet transform) alongside 
the signal so that, at completion of the transform, <I>mask</I> indicates where 
valid coefficients, i.e., coefficients resulting from non-transparent segments 
in the input signal, reside in the output <I>signal</I>. The transformed mask 
is returned in <I>mask</I>, overwriting the original input mask. <P>
Currently,  <B>QccWAVWaveletShapeAdaptiveDWT1D()</B> 
supports only biorthogonal wavelets. These may be used with symmetric extension 
(lifting or filter-bank implementations) or boundary-wavelet extension (lifting 
implementations only). <P>
Segments within <I>signal</I> may be of any length, odd 
or even. In the case of odd segment length, either the lowpass or highpass 
subband at the next coarser scale will be one sample longer than the other; 
which one is longer depends on whether the segment starts with an even- 
or odd-indexed sample relative to the start of <I>signal</I>. A segment of length 
one, i.e., an isolated signal sample, is somewhat of a degenerate case. <B>QccWAVWaveletShapeAdaptiveDWT1D()</B> 
handles a length-1 segment as follows. If the isolated  sample is even-indexed 
relative to the start of <I>signal</I>, then the sample value is multiplied by 
<A HREF="sqrt.2.html">sqrt(2)</A>
 and placed in the lowpass band. If the isolated sample is odd-index, 
it is divided by <A HREF="sqrt.2.html">sqrt(2)</A>
 and placed in the highpass band. <P>
<B>QccWAVWaveletInverseShapeAdaptiveDWT1D()</B> 
performs the inverse SA-DWT of <I>signal</I> which is assumed to have been produced 
by <B>QccWAVWaveletShapeAdaptiveDWT1D()</B>. <I>mask</I> should be the corresponding 
Lazy-wavelet transformed mask also produced by <B>QccWAVWaveletShapeAdaptiveDWT1D()</B>. 
<I>num_scales</I> gives the number of levels of decomposition that exist in <I>signal</I>. 
 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">RETURN VALUES </A></H2>
These routines return 0 on success and 1 on error.  
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4">NOTES 
</A></H2>
SA-DWTs have been recently included in Version 2 of the MPEG-4 standard, 
wherein they are used for  texture coding of arbitrarily shaped still 
objects. Li and Li (see below) elaborate at length on the shape-adaptive 
DWT used in MPEG-4, and also consider some variants not included in the 
MPEG-4 standard. <P>
The SA-DWT implemented in QccPack differs slightly from 
the transform specified by MPEG-4. The most significant difference is in 
the handling of isolated samples  (i.e., segments with length one). In MPEG-4, 
isolated samples are always multiplied by <A HREF="sqrt.2.html">sqrt(2)</A>
 and placed in the lowpass 
band regardless of the parity of the index of the sample. Another difference 
is that the QccPack SA-DWT can handle boundary-wavelet extension in addition 
to symmetric extension for lifting implementations of wavelets; MPEG-4 
uses only symmetric extension. Finally, Li and Li describe several SA-DWT 
variants that are currently not implemented in QccPack, namely, SA-DWTs 
using orthonormal wavelets or biorthogonal wavelets with even-length symmetric 
filters.
