.TH QCCWAVSUBBANDPYRAMIDINTCOPY 3 "QCCPACK" ""
.SH NAME
QccWAVSubbandPyramidIntCopy \- 
copy integer-valued subband pyramid
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "libQccPack.h"
.sp
.BI "int QccWAVSubbandPyramidIntCopy(QccWAVSubbandPyramidInt *" subband_pyramid1 ", const QccWAVSubbandPyramidInt *" subband_pyramid2 );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.BR QccWAVSubbandPyramidIntCopy()
copies the contexts of
.I subband_pyramid2
to
.IR subband_pyramid1 .
If
.I subband_pyramid1
is not allocated prior to the call to
.BR QccWAVSubbandPyramidIntCopy() ,
.BR QccWAVSubbandPyramidIntAlloc (3)
is called to allocate
.I subband_pryamid1
to the same size as
.IR subband_pyramid2 .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
This routine returns 0 on success, and 1 on failure.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR QccWAVSubbandPyramidIntAlloc (3),
.BR QccWAVSubbandPyramidInt (3),
