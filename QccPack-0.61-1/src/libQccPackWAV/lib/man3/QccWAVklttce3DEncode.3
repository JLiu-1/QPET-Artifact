.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Encoding
.LP
.B QccWAVklttce3DEncode()
encodes an image cube,
.IR image ,
using a 3D generalization of the TCE algorithm that involves
a KLT transform in one dimension and a dyadic DWT in the other two.
See "ALGORITHM" below for more detail.
.LP
.I image
is the image cube to be coded and
.I buffer
is the output bitstream.
.I buffer
must be of
.B QCCBITBUFFER_OUTPUT
type and opened via a prior call to
.BR QccBitBufferStart (3).
.LP
.BR QccWAVklttce3DEncode ()
first applies a KLT in the spectral or temporal dimension of the
image cube; subsequently, a dyadic DWT is applied spatially.
.IR num_levels
give the number of levels of wavelet decomposition to perform.
.I wavelet
is the wavelet to use for decomposition.
.LP
.BR QccWAVklttce3DEncode()
uses
.BR QccHYPkltTrain (3)
and
.BR QccHYPkltTransform (3)
to train and apply, respectively, the spectral KLT.
Then,
.BR QccWAVSubbandPyramid3DDWT (3)
with zero temporal decomposition levels
is used to apply the spatial DWT to each frame of the image cube.
.BR QccWAVklttce3DEncode()
embeds the KLT transform matrix into the output bitstream as overhead
information.
.LP
The KLT+3D-TCE algorithm performance is in part through
the parameter
.IR alpha ,
a value that gives the learning rate of the density-estimation
process implemented by the tarp filter used in one of
the coding passes of the TCE algorithm.
.LP
The bitstream output from the KLT+3D-TCE encoder is embedded, meaning that
any prefix of the bitstream can be decoded to give a valid 
representation of the image.  The KLT+3D-TCE encoder essentially produces
output bits until the number of bits output reaches
.IR target_bit_cnt ,
the desired (target) total length of the output bitstream in bits,
and then it stops.
Note that this is the bitstream length in bits, not the rate of the bitstream
(which would be expressed in bits per voxel).
.LP
.SS Decoding
.LP
.B QccWAVklttce3DDecodeHeader()
decodes the header information 
in a bitstream previously produced by
.BR QccWAVklttce3DEncode() .
The input bitstream is
.I buffer
which must be of
.B QCCBITBUFFER_INPUT
type and opened via a prior call to
.BR QccBitBufferStart (3).
.LP
The header information is returned in
.I num_levels
(number of levels of wavelet decomposition in the spatial directions),
.I num_frames
(size of the image cube in the temporal direction),
.I num_rows
(vertical size of image cube),
.I num_cols
(horizontal size of image cube),
.I max_coefficient_bits
(indicates the precision, in number of bits, of the wavelet coefficient
with the largest magnitude),
and
.I alpha
(the value of the learning rate).
.LP
.B QccWAVklttce3DDecode()
decodes the bitstream
.IR buffer ,
producing the reconstructed image cube,
.IR image .
The bitstream must already have had its header read by a prior call
to
.B QccWAVklttce3DDecodeHeader()
(i.e., you call
.B QccWAVklttce3DDecodeHeader() 
first and then
.BR QccWAVklttce3DDecode() ).
If
.I target_bit_cnt
is
.BR QCCENT_ANYNUMBITS ,
then decoding stops when the end of the input bitstream is reached;
otherwise, decoding stops when
.I target_num_bits
from the input bitstream have been decoded.
.SH "ALGORITHM"
The original TCE algorithm (see
.BR QccWAVtce3DEncode() )
was developed for 2D images by
Tian and Hemami;
it was latter extended to 3D by Zhang
.IR "et al" .
Zhang
.IR "et al" .
considered two versions of 3D-TCE: one using a 3D wavelet transform (this is
implemented here as
.BR QccWAVtce3DEncode (3) )
and one with a hybrid transform consisting of a spectral KLT followed
by a spatial dyadic DWT (i.e., KLT+3D-TCE as implemented by
.BR QccWAVklttce3DEncode() ).
