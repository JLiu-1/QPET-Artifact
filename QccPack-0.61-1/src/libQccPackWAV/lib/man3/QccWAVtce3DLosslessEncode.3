.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Encoding
.LP
.B QccWAVtce3DLosslessEncode()
encodes an image cube,
.IR image ,
using a 3D generalization of the TCE algorithm.
The original TCE algorithm was developed for lossy coding of 2D images by
Tian and Hemami;
it was latter extended to 3D
and made lossless via the incorporation reversible transforms
by Zhang
.IR "et al" .
.LP
.I image
is the image cube to be coded and
.I buffer
is the output bitstream.
.I buffer
must be of
.B QCCBITBUFFER_OUTPUT
type and opened via a prior call to
.BR QccBitBufferStart (3).
.LP
.BR QccWAVtce3DLosslessEncode ()
supports the use of both wavelet-packet and dyadic wavelet-transform
decompositions.
If
.IR transform_type
is
.BR QCCWAVSUBBANDPYRAMID3D_DYADIC ,
a dyadic DWT is used; if
.IR transform_type
is
.BR QCCWAVSUBBANDPYRAMID3D_PACKET ,
a wavelet-packet DWT is used.
.IR temporal_num_levels 
and
.IR spatial_num_levels
give the number of levels of wavelet decomposition to perform
for both transform types; for a dyadic transform,
.IR temporal_num_levels 
should equal
.IR spatial_num_levels .
.I wavelet
is the integer-to-integer wavelet to use for decomposition.
.LP
The 3D-TCE algorithm performance is in part through
the parameter
.IR alpha ,
a value that gives the learning rate of the density-estimation
process implemented by the tarp filter used in one of
the coding passes of the TCE algorithm.
.LP
The bitstream output from the 3D-TCE encoder is embedded, meaning that
any prefix of the bitstream can be decoded to give a valid, albeit lossy,
representation of the image.
.LP
.SS Decoding
.LP
.B QccWAVtce3DLosslessDecodeHeader()
decodes the header information 
in a bitstream previously produced by
.BR QccWAVtce3DLosslessEncode() .
The input bitstream is
.I buffer
which must be of
.B QCCBITBUFFER_INPUT
type and opened via a prior call to
.BR QccBitBufferStart (3).
.LP
The header information is returned in
.I transform_type
(either
.BR QCCWAVSUBBANDPYRAMID3D_DYADIC 
or
.BR QCCWAVSUBBANDPYRAMID3D_PACKET 
to indicate a dyadic or wavelet-packet transform decomposition, respectively),
.I temporal_num_levels
(number of levels of wavelet decomposition in the temporal direction),
.I spatial_num_levels
(number of levels of wavelet decomposition in the spatial directions),
.I num_frames
(size of the image cube in the temporal direction),
.I num_rows
(vertical size of image cube),
.I num_cols
(horizontal size of image cube),
.I image_mean
(the mean value of the original image cube),
.I max_coefficient_bits
(indicates the precision, in number of bits, of the wavelet coefficient
with the largest magnitude),
and
.I alpha
(the value of the learning rate).
.LP
.B QccWAVtce3DLosslessDecode()
decodes the bitstream
.IR buffer ,
producing the reconstructed image cube,
.IR image .
The bitstream must already have had its header read by a prior call
to
.B QccWAVtce3DLosslessDecodeHeader()
(i.e., you call
.B QccWAVtce3DLosslessDecodeHeader() 
first and then
.BR QccWAVtce3DLosslessDecode() ).
If
.I target_bit_cnt
is
.BR QCCENT_ANYNUMBITS ,
then decoding stops when the end of the input bitstream is reached;
i.e.,
.IR image
will be a lossless reconstruction of the original image.
Otherwise, decoding stops when
.I target_num_bits
from the input bitstream have been decoded which
will produce a lossy representation that differs from the
originally encoded image.
