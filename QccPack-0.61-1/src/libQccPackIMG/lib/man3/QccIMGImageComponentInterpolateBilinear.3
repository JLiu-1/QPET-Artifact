.TH QCCIMGIMAGECOMPONENTINTERPOLATEBILINEAR 3 "QCCPACK" ""
.SH NAME
QccIMGImageComponentInterpolateBilinear,
QccIMGImageComponentInterpolateFilter
\- 
interpolation of an image component
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "libQccPack.h"
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR QccIMGImageComponentInterpolateBilinear()
performs bilinear interpolation on
.IR image_component1
producing an image component of twice the size
which is returned as
.IR image_component2 .
.IR image_component2
must be allocated such that its number of rows and number of columns
are twice the number of rows and columns, respectively, of
.IR image_component1 ;
this allocation must be done prior to calling
.BR QccIMGImageComponentInterpolateBilinear() .
.LP
.BR QccIMGImageComponentInterpolateFilter()
also performs interpolation of
.IR image_component1
to twice its size, returning the larger image component as
.IR image_component2 .
However, unlike
.BR QccIMGImageComponentInterpolateBilinear() ,
.BR QccIMGImageComponentInterpolateFilter()
uses an explicit interpolation
.IR filter ,
rather than bilinear interpolation.
.BR QccFilterVector (3)
with symmetric extension at the
image-component boundaries is used
successively on the rows and columns of
.IR image_component1
to provide the interpolated pixels.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
These routines return 0 on success and 1 on error.
