.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR QccIMGImageCubeExtractBlock()
extracts a
.I block
of size
.IR block_num_frames
by
.IR block_num_rows
by
.IR block_num_cols
from
.IR image_cube .
The
.I block
is extracted such that the low-indexed corner of the extracted
.I block
lies at location
.RI ( image_frame ", " image_row ", " image_col )
in
.IR image_cube ;
i.e., a diagonal of the nominal cube to be extracted would run from
.RI ( image_frame ", " image_row ", " image_col )
to
.RI ( image_frame " + " block_num_frames ", " image_row " + "
.IR block_num_rows ", "
.IR image_col " + " block_num_cols ).
If any part of the extracted
.I block
lies beyond the bounds of
.IR image_cube ,
the corresponding voxels in
.IR block
beyond the image-cube bounds are set to 0.
.LP
.BR QccIMGImageCubeInsertBlock()
inserts a
.IR block
of size
.IR block_num_frames
by
.IR block_num_rows
by
.IR block_num_cols
into
.IR image_cube
at location
.RI ( image_frame ", " image_row ", " image_col ).
Any part of the inserted
.IR block
that would lie beyond the bounds of
.IR image_cube
is ignored, i.e., not inserted into
.IR image_cube .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
These routines return 0 on success and 1 on error.
